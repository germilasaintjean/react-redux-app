      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>There is an old saying, <strong>"The pen is mightier than the sword."</strong>Ideas written down have changed the destiny of men and nations for better or worse. The flow of ideas cannot be stopped. We need to read and research to build on the good ideas and expose the bad ideas before they bring destruction. Only by reading can we be armed in this never-ending, life-and-death struggle.</p>
      <p>Books plays an important role in in our life. It is said that books are our best companions. Books are real friends in our lives . They demand nothing from us. They give us plenty of joy. We also learn a lot from them. They take us into a different world of imagination.</p>
